Adnan’s BFHL Data Processor is a full-stack project built as part of the Bajaj Finserv Health | Full Stack.
The application provides a simple yet powerful REST API along with a custom frontend that processes user input data (numbers, alphabets, and special characters) and returns structured insights.

🔹 Key Highlights

REST API (Node.js + Express)

Accepts an array of values and separates them into even numbers, odd numbers, alphabets, and special characters.

Calculates the sum of all numbers and returns it as a string.

Generates a reverse concatenated string of alphabets in alternating caps.

Always responds with a unique user_id, email, and roll number.

Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)

Clean and modern UI with a custom teal-gray + amber theme.

Responsive layout: input form spans wider space, results stack gracefully on smaller screens.

Interactive features:

🚀 Process Data button with gradient + hover animation

⚠️ Input validation and error handling

📜 Collapsible section to view raw JSON response from the API

✨ Smooth animations for result cards

Personalized with user profile info and a custom footer:

“Built with ❤️ by Adnan Rizvi”

🎯 Purpose

This project is a demonstration of API design, deployment, and frontend integration.
It showcases my ability to:

Build REST APIs with proper validation and structured responses.

Deploy backend services to cloud platforms like Vercel.

Design responsive and user-friendly frontends using React and Tailwind CSS.

Apply thoughtful UI/UX touches that make the app look handcrafted.
